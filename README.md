# Semantic Segmentation with CNN and U-Net

# Overview
This project involves training and evaluating semantic segmentation models using the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset. The task includes implementing two different architectures: a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) without skip connections and a U-Net with skip connections. The project demonstrates dataset preparation, model training, and result visualization.

# Dataset

Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset
Description: A dataset containing images of pets with segmentation masks for different regions of interest.
Source: Available through libraries like Keras (keras.datasets.oxford_iiit_pet) or PyTorch (torchvision.datasets).

Objective: Use the dataset to train and test models for semantic segmentation.

# Project Workflow

1. Dataset Preparation
Split the Dataset:

Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Further split the training set into training and validation subsets.

2. Model Training and Evaluation

2.1 Simple CNN for Semantic Segmentation
Train a basic CNN without skip connections.
Outputs:
Training and validation loss plots as a function of epochs.
Quantitative results for training, validation, and testing datasets.
Visualizations of inference results (segmentation maps).

2.2 U-Net for Semantic Segmentation
Train a U-Net architecture with skip connections for improved performance.

Outputs:

Similar evaluations as with the simple CNN:
Loss and evaluation metrics plotted against epochs.
Segmentation visualizations.
Quantitative performance results on training, validation, and testing subsets.

Results

1. Evaluation Metrics
2. Loss: Measure of model performance during training and validation.
3. Accuracy: Comparison of predicted segmentation against ground truth.
4. Visualization: Side-by-side comparisons of input images, ground truth masks, and predicted segmentation results.

How to Run the Project

1. Dataset Download:

Use Keras or PyTorch to load the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset.

2. Train Models:

# Conclusion
This project showcases the differences in performance between a simple CNN and a U-Net for semantic segmentation. The U-Net, with its skip connections, is expected to outperform the basic CNN in terms of accuracy and visual quality.
